Searching the Internet...

I had trouble searching the internet, so I'm going to continue without it.Sure! Here's a detailed README file for the project:

# Project Name

Search Engine

## Description

This project is a search engine that allows users to search for documents based on their queries. It utilizes a simple search algorithm that ranks documents based on their relevance to the query.

## Features

- Tokenization: The search engine tokenizes the documents and queries, breaking them down into individual words or tokens.
- Normalization: The tokens are normalized by converting them to lowercase and removing any punctuation or special characters.
- Stop Words Removal: Common stop words, such as "the," "and," or "is," are removed from the tokens to improve search accuracy.
- Stemming: The search engine applies stemming to the tokens, reducing them to their root form. This helps to match different variations of the same word.
- Inverted Index: An inverted index is created, which maps each token to the documents it appears in. This allows for efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on the query.
- Ranking: The search algorithm ranks the documents based on their relevance to the query. The ranking is determined by factors such as the frequency of the query terms in the document and the document's overall length.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your documents by storing them in a directory or a database.
3. Run the search engine script by executing `python search_engine.py`.
4. Enter your query when prompted by the script.
5. The search engine will process the query and return a list of relevant documents based on their ranking.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the search engine:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your documents by storing them in a directory called "documents".
3. Run the search engine script by executing `python search_engine.py`.
4. Enter your query when prompted by the script. For example, you can enter "machine learning".
5. The search engine will process the query and return a list of relevant documents based on their ranking.

## Limitations

- The search engine currently supports only basic text-based queries. It does not handle complex queries or advanced search operators.
- The ranking algorithm used in this project is a simple one and may not always produce the most accurate results.
- The search engine may not perform well with large datasets or in scenarios where real-time indexing and retrieval are required.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the search algorithm to support more advanced features, such as phrase matching, fuzzy matching, or synonym detection.
- Implement a more sophisticated ranking algorithm that takes into account factors like document popularity or user feedback.
- Optimize the indexing and retrieval process to improve performance with larger datasets.
- Develop a user interface to provide a more user-friendly experience for interacting with the search engine.
